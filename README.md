# HW6-Weather-Dashboard

For this project, I created a website that displays weather conditions for a city. When a user searches a city through the site, they are presented with information on the current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for the searched city. For this site, I used a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the Open Weather Service API. 

#Purpose
This project gave me experience with using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and Server APIs to create a functioning application.

#Usage
